I compiled here a forest land-use data from GCAM-Demeter (Chen et al 2020). I used the mean of five GCMs and the first version (Harmonized projection) to assess the forest classes through time and scenarios. The outputs provided here are the sum of raw Forest classes (codes PFT1 to PFT11- describe above) for Global extent in the Tag Image File Format (TIFF) format that is more friendly and useable to incorporate in several spatial analyses. 

The netcdf raw files provide 32 lan tipe classes classes . To sum forest classes, I considere :

PFT1- Needleleaf evergreen tree: temperate
PFT2- Needleleaf evergreen tree: boreal
PFT3- Needleleaf deciduous tree: boreal
PFT4- Broadleaf evergreen tree: tropical
PFT5- Broadleaf evergreen tree: temperate
PFT6- Broadleaf deciduous tree: tropical
PFT7- Broadleaf deciduous tree: temperate
PFT8- Broadleaf deciduous tree: boreal
PFT9- Broadleaf evergreen shrub: temperate
PFT10- Broadleaf deciduous shrub: temperate
PFT11- Broadleaf deciduous shrub: boreal

The land classe types excludeed are:

PFT0- Water
PFT12-
PFT13-
PFT14-
PFT15-
PFT16-
PFT17-
PFT18-
PFT19-
PFT20-
PFT21-
PFT22-
PFT23-
PFT24-
PFT25-
PFT26-
PFT27-
PFT28-
PFT29-
PFT30-
PFT31-
PFT32-

The data are available for:

1- Global Extent at  0.05-degree resolution 
2- Years 2020, 2030 and 2050
3- Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) as follow: SSP1_RCP2, SSP2_RCP45, SSP4_RCP6, SSP5_RCP85.
4- It can be identified by its file name. Example :
2020_SSP5_RCP85_Forest_GCAM-Demeter_GCMsMean_Harmonized.tif
