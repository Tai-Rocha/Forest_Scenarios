Forested land-use data from GCAM-Demeter (Chen et al. 2020) considering the mean of five General Circulation Models(GCMs gfdl, hadgem, ipsl, miroc, and noresmand) and the first version (Harmonized projection) to assess the forested land through time and global change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)). The outputs of forest lands provided here are the sum of plant functional types (codes PFT1 to PFT11- described below) in the Tag Image File Format (TIFF) that is more friendly and useable format to incorporate in several spatial analyses in ecology and biodiversity studies. 

The NetCDF raw files provide 32 land types. To the sum analysis to obtain forested land, I consider :

PFT1- Needleleaf evergreen tree: temperate
PFT2- Needleleaf evergreen tree: boreal
PFT3- Needleleaf deciduous tree: boreal
PFT4- Broadleaf evergreen tree: tropical
PFT5- Broadleaf evergreen tree: temperate
PFT6- Broadleaf deciduous tree: tropical
PFT7- Broadleaf deciduous tree: temperate
PFT8- Broadleaf deciduous tree: boreal
PFT9- Broadleaf evergreen shrub: temperate
PFT10- Broadleaf deciduous shrub: temperate
PFT11- Broadleaf deciduous shrub: boreal

The land  types excluded:

PFT0- Water
PFT12- C3 Arctic
PFT13- C3 Grass
PFT14- C4 Grass
PFT15- Corn: rainfed
PFT16- Corn: irrigated
PFT17- Wheat: rainfed
PFT18- Wheat: irrigated
PFT19- Soybean: rainfed
PFT20- Soybean: irrigated
PFT21- Cotton: rainfed
PFT22- Cotton: irrigated
PFT23- Rice: rainfed
PFT24- Rice: irrigated
PFT25- Sugar crop: rainfed
PFT26- Sugar crop: irrigated
PFT27- Other crop: rainfed
PFT28- Other crop: irrigate
PFT29- Bioenergy crop: rainfed
PFT30- Bioenergy crop: irrigated
PFT31- Urban

Other details about the TIFF outputs results of forest land:

1- Global Extent at 0.05-degree resolution 

2- Years 2020, 2030 and 2050

3- SSPs and RCP as follow: SSP1_RCP2, SSP2_RCP45, SSP4_RCP6, SSP5_RCP85

4-  The output ranges from 0 to 100 and can be identified by its file name, for example: 2020_SSP5_RCP85_Forest_GCAM-Demeter_GCMsMean_Harmonized.tif .
