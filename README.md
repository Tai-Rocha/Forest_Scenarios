# Forest_Scenarios
#### In progress

## Introdcution
This is a repository with scripts to assess the forest land-use classes of GCAM-Demeter dataset under different scenarios of climate change, based on a combination of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Paths (RCPs), as designed by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). This evaluation is being done for three time slices (2020, 2030 and 2050).



## Methods

- [x] Sum Forest classes (codes PTF1 to PTF8)
- [x] Histograms of continuous raster derived from the Sum
- [ ] Choose of reference map (Maybe [Corpernicus](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc) ?)
- [ ] Set of thresholds and choose the best match with a reference map


## Preliminary results
