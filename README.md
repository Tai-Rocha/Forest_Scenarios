# Forest_Scenarios
#### In progress

## Introdcution
This is a repository with scripts to assess the forests land-use classes of [GCAM-Demeter dataset](https://data.pnnl.gov/dataset/13192)  under different scenarios of climate change for three temporal slices (2020, 2030 and 2050).

# Methods

- [x] Sum Forest classes (codes PTF1 to PTF8)
- [x] Histograms of continuous raster derived from the Sum
- [ ] Choose of reference map (Maybe [Corpernicus](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc) ?)
- [ ] Set of thresholds and choose the best match with a reference map
